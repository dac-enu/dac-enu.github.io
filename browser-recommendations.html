				<h2>Web Browser Recommendations</h2>
					<div id="primaryContent">
						<h3>LibreWolf</h3>
						<p>LibreWolf is a privacy and security hardened fork of the free and open-source Firefox web browser. It aims to be an out-of-the-box privacy preserving browser by changing default privacy and security settings, disabling a large majority of telemetry, and bundling it with uBlock Origin, an advertisement and tracker blocker.</p>

						<h3>Mullvad Browser</h3>
						<p>Mullvad is quite like the LibreWolf browser in that it aims to promote further privacy and security as a Firefox derivative. It is created by the same company behind Mullvad VPN. It includes some additional features that come with the Tor Browser bundle such as a script blocking button in the toolbar.</p>

						<h3>GNU IceCat</h3>
						<p>Another Firefox-based browser created by the GNU (GNU's Not Unix) Project with sponsorship from the Free Software Foundation, IceCat seeks to block non-free JavaScript (code that is under a proprietary license) and has countermeasures for fingerprinting techniques. No telemetry is included.</p>

						<h3>Brave Browser</h3>
						<p>Brave is a Chromium-based browser that comes with built-in advertisement and tracker blocking. It includes some cryptocurrency gimicks with their own "Basic Attention Token" (BAT) which is given to users for seeing advertisements in the browser. These can be disabled. It comes with support for viewing sites using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and can use the Tor network too (though the latter is not recommended).</p>

						<h3>Tor Browser</h3>
						<p>The Tor Browser is another Firefox-based browser that seeks to protect the user's privacy as well as their anonymity by routing their traffic through the Tor Network, an onion routing system. Websites that are deployed on the Tor Network usually are better for mitigating traffic analysis as there are more onion nodes between the user's system and the web server. It comes with a simple JavaScript blocker to mitigate some wfingerprinting methods.</p>

						<h3>Ungoogled Chromium</h3>
						<p>Ungoogled Chromium is a Chromium-based browser that is a very simple Chrome-like experience without Google telemetry and features. It is good if you like a very simple web browser without a lot of fuss, though it does not have much ad or web tracker blocking.</p>
